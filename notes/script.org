#+title: Presentation Notes


* Questions for baris
- how many datasets was this filter used on
- how many cars were tested

- acceleration equivalence (axis called differently)
- video of filtering (left unfiltered  ,right filtered)

* Script


** Overview of our model

- got through the figure
- had a problem with this part in previouse work
- discrete dataset lead to big discretization error

- in a nutshell we want to try to find a more accurate integration formula

** Our approach
- very similar to other discrete integration models
- using a linear model for the distance and velocity
- some constants c_1 to c_4
- get the next distance/velocity by using current and previous data


- now for the neural network our supervisors were working with they needed ground truth of accerleration
- problem was that these two acccelerations didnt add up or were not equal before
- will show graphs later
- by using linear model instead of formulas we hoped to minimize the error


Will look at the results now
First the scenario filtering

** Results
*** Scenario Filtering
- here we have a side by side view of a portion of our dataset visualized
- on the left we have the unfiltered dataset
- on the right we have the filtered dataset
- here we have an exiting scenario
  (This was done on x datasets)

- Now we will take a look at the results of our integration model

*** Integration Method
- this was the results before
- acceleration didnt add up
- x-axis was firts formula, y-axis second formula
- after finetuning our results add up way better

- so we got a model that could predict the acceleration of the car quite comfortably
- rearanging the formula give us the velocity and distance
- ofc visualized our results!
- left: ground truth
- right: predicted car
- matches up quite nicely
- but at end on sidewalk (in depth analysis in the report)

*** Summary
- filtering mech
- integration method with matching accelerations
- visualized car

** Future work
- more scnearios
- greater variety of filtere datasets to work with
- use other datsets to test method

- finetune model for better accuracy
  as have seen there still was some error in the test set
  though that might be enough already!
- test model with the neural network
- task for the next team
