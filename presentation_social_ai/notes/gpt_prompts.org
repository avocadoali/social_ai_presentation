We have to make a presentation

I am a college student, studying computer science. For the remainder of this conversation I want you to respond from a college teachers point of view. When I ask you a question, I don't only want you to give me the answer, but I want you to clearly explain step by step, how you found that answer. Occasionally ask if I understand everything and if there is anything that we have discussed that I want to readdress.

Can you help me with presentation I have to prepare for a seminar. The title is Motionn Planning of Autonomous Vehicles: Scene-aware and Social-aware Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving.
This is the presentation structure I came up with. Can you add bulletpoints to it?



* Motivation
First I want to tacle the motivation and problem statement.
Write a short introductory text for the presentation using incorporating the following information we got:

Motivation
Understanding motion behavior of human-driven vehicles is critical for attaining safety of autonomous driving.
This prediction is challenging because human motion is inherently multimodal and scene-dependent [1] Social acceptance is crucial in prediction.
Some trajectories are physically possible but socially unacceptable.
Human drivers typically respect social norms like yielding right-of-way or respecting person In recent years, tools from social-aware artificial intelligence (AI) have been used to predict the behaviour of humans and human drivers [2] [3] Problem: these tools work well, but are not control-oriented! (no system model, no easy interpretation for the intents of interacting agents)

** Answer
Motivation:
    Autonomous driving promises safer and more efficient transportation.
    Understanding human-driven vehicle motion behaviors is crucial for ensuring the safety of autonomous driving.
    Human motion is inherently multimodal and intricately tied to the surrounding scene [1].

Challenges:
    Prediction of human behavior is complicated by the challenges of multimodality and scene dependence.
    Social acceptance plays a crucial role in predicting trajectories.
    Some trajectories may be physically possible but socially unacceptable.
    Human drivers adhere to social norms, such as yielding right-of-way or respecting pedestrians.

Current Approaches:

    Tools from social-aware artificial intelligence (AI) have been used to predict human behavior [2] [3].
    However, existing tools lack a control-oriented perspective.
    They lack a systematic representation through a system model, making interpretation of interacting agents' intents challenging.



* Research goals
First I want to tacle the research goals and our goals for the team.
Write a short text for the presentation using incorporating the following information we got:

Research Golas
1) Test and evaluate state of the art
Test some of these social-aware AI tools (e.g. SVG-net);
Apply to relevant CommonRoad scenarios;
Consider different scenarios: curved roads, intersections, etc;
Sensitivity analysis (i.e. generalization capabilities);

2) New control-oriented (interpretable) tools
Use Kalman prediction as the basic framework;
Scene context: incorporate constraints;
Multi-agent context: cooperative prediction (information sharing);
Multi-modal context: include virtual forces among agents;

 Our goal
1) Test and evaluate state of the art
Consider different scenarios: curved roads, intersections, etc;

2) New control-oriented (interpretable) tools
Multi-modal context: include virtual forces among agents;
** Answer
Research Goals:

    Testing and Evaluation of State-of-the-Art:
        We aim to rigorously test and evaluate cutting-edge social-aware AI tools, such as SVG-net.
        The evaluation will involve the application of these tools to relevant CommonRoad scenarios, covering a spectrum of situations, including curved roads, intersections, and more.
        Our research will explore different scenarios to understand the tools' performance across a variety of road situations.
        We will conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the generalization capabilities of these tools.

    Development of New Control-Oriented (Interpretable) Tools:
        Utilizing Kalman prediction as the foundational framework, we aspire to create new tools that enhance interpretability.
        Our approach involves incorporating scene context to introduce constraints within the predictive models.
        In a multi-agent context, we plan to implement cooperative prediction, emphasizing information sharing among agents.
        Considering a multi-modal context, our goal is to include virtual forces among agents, providing a richer and more dynamic predictive model.

Our Goal:

    Testing and Evaluation of State-of-the-Art:
        Similar to the broader research goals, our team will focus on testing and evaluating state-of-the-art tools.
        We will particularly explore different scenarios, including curved roads, intersections, and other relevant road situations.

    Development of New Control-Oriented (Interpretable) Tools:
        Our team's primary objective aligns with the research goal of creating new control-oriented and interpretable tools.
        Specifically, we will concentrate on the multi-modal context, incorporating virtual forces among agents to enhance the predictive capabilities of our models.
