#+title: Presentation Notes

* Structure

** Project Goals:
    Outline the specific goals of your project, such as predicting trajectories, detecting patterns, or optimizing routes.

- create a linear model that predicts the trajectory of the cars.
- more specifically, create an discrete integration method that give a continuous data (picture of datapoints -> corresponding graph)
- acceleration parameters should be the same over all integration formulas (show the initial formula and then the rearanged model such that the acceleration matches)

** Data Collection:
    Describe the dataset used for the analysis
    Mention the source of the data and any preprocessing steps applied.

    (Picture of the rqth github repo, and dataset maybe)
    (Show a )

** Methodology:
    Explain the coding approach or algorithm used for trajectory analysis.
    Discuss any machine learning models, computer vision techniques, or other methodologies implemented.

- using python (numpy, pandas)
- in the end it is just a linear regression model (show all the formulas of the model)
- choose one and shortly explain what the parameters are (higlight one formula)

- took the columns of distance, speed, and acceleration, concated them run them through the model
- create test set and training set

- now we got the parameters for said model (show the coefficient value)
- plug them back into the integration model (show the equation and highlight the coefficients)

** Results:
    Present the results of your analysis.
    Discuss any insights gained, anomalies detected, or patterns observed.

    Include visual representations of car trajectories.
    Use graphs, charts, or maps to illustrate key findings or patterns.

(Visualization of predicted car vs actual car)
(Show the graphs of the predictions)


** Challenges Faced:

    Talk about any challenges encountered during the project and how you overcame them.
    Discuss limitations of your approach or areas for improvement.

** Future Work:

    Share potential extensions or improvements for the project.
    Discuss how the project could be expanded or applied in real-world scenarios.

** Motivation and problem statement
*** Problem statement
Motivation:
    Autonomous driving promises safer and more efficient transportation.
    Understanding human-driven vehicle motion behaviors is crucial for ensuring the safety of autonomous driving.
    Human motion is inherently multimodal and intricately tied to the surrounding scene [1].

Challenges:
    Prediction of human behavior is complicated by the challenges of multimodality and scene dependence.
    Social acceptance plays a crucial role in predicting trajectories.
    Some trajectories may be physically possible but socially unacceptable.
    Human drivers adhere to social norms, such as yielding right-of-way or respecting pedestrians.

Current Approaches:

    Tools from social-aware artificial intelligence (AI) have been used to predict human behavior [2] [3].
    However, existing tools lack a control-oriented perspective.
    They lack a systematic representation through a system model, making interpretation of interacting agents' intents challenging.

*** Our approach
Testing and Evaluation of State-of-the-Art:
        Similar to the broader research goals, our team will focus on testing and evaluating state-of-the-art tools.
        We will particularly explore different scenarios, including curved roads, intersections, and other relevant road situations.

Development of New Control-Oriented (Interpretable) Tools:
        Our team's primary objective aligns with the research goal of creating new control-oriented and interpretable tools.
        Specifically, we will concentrate on the multi-modal context, incorporating virtual forces among agents to enhance the predictive capabilities of our models.

Premise:
- premise is, car interacting with other cars as this is a human driving a car
- when driving alone on a street you are drive differently as when other cars are present
- some paths or actions are physically possible but might be 'socially' unaccaptable for humans

Our approach:
- introduce virtual forces between the cars to enhance prediction of movement
- these hypothetical forces enable us to predict cars movement in higher accuracy by including the interaction of a car with other cars surrounding us.
- we do that by analysing two cars in specific scenarios e.g (car lane changing, exiting lane, entering lane, overtaking)

How the analisation works in our case:
- we need a model that somehow explains the movement of the car such that we can use it for the neural network for predicting the movement of the car
- the neural network will then integreate
- the input of the human is the accerlation pedal in the car
- this will be ou

problem
- we have a discrete dataset since measurements are taken in time intervalls
- problem until know that we have a big error if we plug it into the neural network model
- we want to approximate the actual continuous movement of the car to feed that into the neural network for analysis
- It is using the acceleration as ground truth, as a human decides the acceleration of the car via the pedal we want a integration model that works for discretized datasets, that can calculate the speed and velocity of the car by the acceleration input.


** Detailed description of the implemented method
*** Alfred


Firstly load the dataset of the cars




our approach
- using a model to describe the movement of the car using a linear model which can be solve using Linear Regression
- was trained on X data with Y entries
- results and compare it to old models while our model was x-times better than the old one whilst having the acceleration equivalence
- show the visualization results






** Advantages and disadvantages of the implementation

** Motivation
Understanding motion behavior of human-driven vehicles is critical for attaining safety of autonomous driving.
This prediction is challenging because human motion is inherently multimodal and scene-dependent [1] Social acceptance is crucial in prediction.
Some trajectories are physically possible but socially unacceptable.
Human drivers typically respect social norms like yielding right-of-way or respecting person In recent years, tools from social-aware artificial intelligence (AI) have been used to predict the behaviour of humans and human drivers [2] [3] Problem: these tools work well, but are not control-oriented! (no system model, no easy interpretation for the intents of interacting agents)

** Research goals
1) Test and evaluate state of the art
Test some of these social-aware AI tools (e.g. SVG-net);
Apply to relevant CommonRoad scenarios;
Consider different scenarios: curved roads, intersections, etc;
Sensitivity analysis (i.e. generalization capabilities);

2) New control-oriented (interpretable) tools
Use Kalman prediction as the basic framework;
Scene context: incorporate constraints;
Multi-agent context: cooperative prediction (information sharing);
Multi-modal context: include virtual forces among agents;
