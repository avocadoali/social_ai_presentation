#+title: Presentation Notes
* Structure
** Motivation and problem statement
Premise:
- autonomous driving promises safer and more efficient transportation.
- understanding human-driven vehicle motion behaviors is crucial for ensuring the safety of autonomous driving.
- premise is, car interacting with other cars as this is a human driving a car
- when driving alone on a street you drive differently as when other cars are present
- some trajectories may be physically possible but socially unacceptable.
- human drivers adhere to social norms, such as yielding right-of-way or respecting pedestrians.
- thus, we introduce virtual forces between the cars to enhance prediction of movement
- A neural network will try to modulate these forces and will enable us to predict the car movements in higher accuracy by including the interaction of a car with other cars surrounding it

Our task:
Baris
- analysing the forces between cars in different scenarios (lane merging, ...)
-> get the dataset and filter it out by the different scenarios

Alfred
- neural network has problems using the current integration methods
- big dicretization and other errors because we are working with data points (not continuous graph)
-> find a more accurate discrete integration model that predicts the movement of the car better

Graphics:

Picture of a car with two paths (one physically possible, one socially accepted)
Table of the tasks of what Baris/Alfreds tasks are

** Detailed description of the implemented method
*** Data Collection:
Content:
Describe the dataset used for the analysis
- How where they taken
- How many data points
- What scenarios
- Show the dataset as video

Graphics:
Picture of the rwth aach github repo, and dataset maybe
Show a video of the moving cars

*** Baris' part
Content:
What did you use
What measures did you take for the scenarios
How many datapoints did you run through

Graphics:
- an overview of the parameters of how you filtered the data??

*** Alfreds part
Content:
How does the model look like?
- explain that data is discrete and we need to find a method to integrate discrete datapoints
- now we ant to use a linear model for the prediction
- have to equlize the accerleration for the neural network
- tested 10 different model and got the following
- solved this by using linear regression (using python, numpy and pandas)

Graphics:
- Show ballistic integration
- Show 10 models we tried (focus the one we used)

** Results
Evaluation:
Successes/Problems of filtering out scenarios
- Successfully filtered X datapoints and Y different scenarios

Successes/Problems of prediciting car movement
- after playing around with some parameters and databatch sizes
- Acceleration and Velocity are more accurate than ballistic integration
- Distance measure is bad (finetune the model)

Out of curiosity we tried to train a model on the scnearios (this would be done by the neural network)
- bad results (bc linear model)

Graphics:
- what for filtering part?
- vdieos of two selected cars in specific scenarios

- show the graphs for the velocity and the distance of the models
- comparison that to the ballistic integration


** Future work
Getting even more scenarios?
Trying out different models for the movement prediction (finetune model, add more parameters)
Analyzing the results even furhter (outliers, distance measure)

Actually testing it with the neural network
Feeding results into the neural network

* Todo
For baris:
Graphics for introducion
- that one picture from Di Lius presentation
- picture of a car with two paths (one physically possible, one socially accepted)
- table of the tasks of what Baris/Alfreds tasks are
- Picture of the rwth aach github repo, and dataset maybe
- video of the moving cars of dataset (to showcase dataset)
- video of moving cars in some scenarios
- an overview of the parameters of how you filtered the data??

For me:
- formulas for ballistic integration
  - accerleration 4 paramters
  - accerleration 7 paramters
  - simple distance
  - simple velocity
  - accleration modeo 6 + 3
  - accleration modeo 6 + 3
- formulas for 10 models we tried (focus the one we used)

- what for filtering part?

- show the graphs for the velocity and the distance of the models
- graph of ballistic integration

- video of the predicted movement of a selected car
